# Unsupervised-Learning-in-R-Supermarket-data-analysis

## Description
A Kenyan Supermarket requires information that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). The plan of approach for this project is to divide it into four parts where we'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on the insights.

Part 1 entails Dimensionality Reduction using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA then analysis will be carried out and insights gained from the analysis will be provided.

Part 2 entails Feature Selection through the use of unsupervised learning methods then analysis and insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset will be provided.

Part 3 entails Association Rules where association rules that will allow us to identify relationships between variables in the dataset will be created. A separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others is used. Additionally, insights from the analysisy will be provided.

Part 4 entails Anomaly Detection, we'll check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.
